### Curl commands 

1. curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh
This part fetches a script from the URL. The flags mean:

-L: Follow redirects (in case the URL redirects somewhere else).

-s: Silent mode (donâ€™t show progress meter).

-S: When used with -s, it makes curl show errors if they occur.

-f: Fail silently on server errors (like 404 or 500).

So this part silently tries to download the script located at https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh, and errors out cleanly if it fails.

2. | sh
This pipes (|) the downloaded script to the sh shell, meaning the script will be executed immediately in a shell environment.
